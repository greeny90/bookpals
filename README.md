Project I / Design &amp; Implement a Relational Database

Semaa and Yvette are building a book swapping management system that allows book owners loan their favorite books to borrowers residing in the same geographical region. Book owners can add the books they wish to share with others.  Book borrowers can select books to borrow within their region. Users can also rate the books.
