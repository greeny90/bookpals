CS5200 - Database Management Systems

Project I / Design &amp; Implement a Relational Database

Semaa and Yvette are building a book swapping management system that allows book owners loan their favorite books to borrowers residing in the same geographical region. Book owners can add the books they wish to share with others.  Book borrowers can select books to borrow within their region. Users can also rate the books.

Changes Proposed By Misha
Very good job, was able to successfully add and delete books. 
Maybe if there was a search filter, I could view the added book in the list but overall a very good attempt.
